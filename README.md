# Noteful Server  

A simple app that allows users to group their notes into folders, view them all at once, or view individual notes in more detail. The selected folder is highlighted so that users can 
more easily distinguish what the current active folder is. Each note also has a back button to enforce specifc routing for the user. This is my first full stack project and does not 
make use of account specific information.

This is the back-end of the full-stack Noteful application. You can check out the repo for the client [here](https://github.com/Human437/noteful) view it live [here](https://noteful-tau-woad.vercel.app)!  

To check out the app, you can create your own notes and add it to your desired folder.
